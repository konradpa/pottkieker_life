# Reactor HUD Design System

> **IMPORTANT:** This design system is MANDATORY for all frontend work. See `/.clinerules` for the complete specification.

## Quick Start

All UI components must follow the "reactor HUD" aesthetic - see the root `.clinerules` file for complete details.

**Key CSS variables are defined in:** `frontend/styles.css`

## Essential Rules

1. Use monospace fonts everywhere
2. 2-3px cyan/teal borders with 0-4px radius
3. Bracketed labels: `[ SECTION NAME ]`
4. Quick 0.2s hover transitions with cyan glow
5. Dark backgrounds with subtle gradients
