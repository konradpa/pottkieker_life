# Streak UI notes

- Keep streak indicators compact: `🔥5` for current, `Best 12` as supporting text.
- Use the existing panel/glow style (bg-3, accent border) for leaderboard rows.
- Keep badges uppercase, small caps; no gradients needed.
- On photo upload success, show streak text inline with other toasts.
- Avoid weekend messaging; streaks auto-skip weekends.
